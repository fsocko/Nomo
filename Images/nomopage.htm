	First, enter the parameters for the nomogram into the text fields 
	that appear in the pop-up windows.  Once all of the parameters have 
	been entered, 
	you can draw a straight line on the nomogram by clicking and
	dragging the mouse and then releasing the mouse button.  
	You may re-draw the line as many times as you wish;
	the line previously drawn will disappear.  Values of all
	three parameters for the line appear at the right.
